# SLURM Scripts to Run the DRAT Verification
These scripts automate the parallel verification of the
transformations done on the CNF formulation of Keller's conjecture.

## Instructions

All shell commands are meant to be run in the top directory of this
repository. The first batch of files with the *.ippr extension are
generated by the s?-python target. For instance, for s=3, running

```bash
$ make s3-python
```

will generate these files.

If needed, this can be run in the cluster environment with

```bash
$ sbatch <sbatch-arguments> slurm/s-python.sh 3
```

After this step is complete, parallel verification can be done with

```bash
$ slurm/s-verify.sh 3
```

which will enqueue all jobs with respective dependencies invoking the
several steps of the toolchian. Once these jobs are done, the files
with the *.log extension will contain the output of the verification
by drat-trim. Each file should have the line

c ERROR: all lemmas verified, but no conflict

You can edit the variables at the top of the verification script
according to the queue names and time limits of your cluster
environment.
